          are not loaded by default on EAP6+.\n                        This likely
          results in a \"java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: sun/rmi/server/UnicastServerRef\"

          issue it is highly recommended to use JTA provided by JBoss EAP since JOTM
          is not maintained anymore.  \n                        \n                        If
          you want to stick with JOTM, you can add \"sun/rmi/server\" as system export
          in your applications deployment-structure.xml as described in [this knowledge
