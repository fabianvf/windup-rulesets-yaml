          are not disrupted by node failure. Each node in the cluster shares information
          about ongoing sessions and can take over sessions if another node disappears.
          In a cloud environment, however, data in the memory of a running container
          can be wiped out by a restart.\n\n                    Recommendations\n\n
          \                   * Review the session replication usage and ensure that
          it is configured properly.\n                    * Disable HTTP session clustering
          and accept its implications.\n                    * Re-architect the application
          so that sessions are stored in a cache backing service or a remote data
          grid.\n\n                    A remote data grid has the following benefits:\n\n
          \                   * The application is more scaleable and elastic.\n                    *
          The application can survive EAP node failures because a JVM failure does
          not cause session data loss.\n                    * Session data can be
          shared by multiple applications.\n                    "
