          a \"main\" class with the @SpringBootApplication annotation. A Quarkus application
          does not have such a class. Two different alternatives can be followed -
          either\n                        to remove the \"main\" class associated
          with the annotation, or add the `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-autoconfigure`
          dependency as an `optional` Maven dependency. An optional dependency \n
          \                       is available when an application compiles but is
          not packaged with the application at runtime. Doing this would allow the
          application to compile without modification, but you\n                        would
          also need to maintain a Spring version along with the Quarkus application.\n
